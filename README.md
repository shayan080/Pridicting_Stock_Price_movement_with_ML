# Introduction
This project leverages machine learning techniques, including supervised learning algorithms, to analyze historical stock data and financial indicators in order to forecast future price movements.

# Objective 

### Predict Stock Prices
Develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast future stock prices based on historical data and financial indicators.

### Contribute to Research
Expand the understanding of how machine learning can be applied to financial forecasting and share findings with the research community.

### Enhanced Investment Decisions
Provide investors with data-driven insights to help them make more informed and profitable investment decisions.

# Proposed Methodology
### Data Collection
Gather historical stock data, financial indicators, and other relevant information from reliable sources.

### Data Preprocessing
Clean and transform the data to ensure it is in the format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### feature Engineering
Identify and extract the most relevant feature from the data that can contribute to accurate price predictions.

### Model Training
Train various supervised learning models, such as regression algorithms, to predict future stock prices.

### Model Evaluation
Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics, such as RMSE, MSE and MAE.

# Results

### Performance Metrics
The trained models achieved and average RMSE of 2.5, MSE of 6.25 and MAE of 1.8 on the testing data, indicating a strong predictive capability.

### Insights Gained
The analysis revealed that factors such as P/E ratio, trading volume, and macroecnomics indicators are the most influentials in predicting stock prices movements.

### Practical Application
The developed models can be integrated into investment decision-making processes to help investors make more informed and profitable trading decisions.
