# Pridicting_Stock_Price_movement_with_ML

# Introduction
This project leverages machine learning techniques, including supervised learning algorithms, to analyze historical stock data and financial indicators in order to forecast future price movements.

# Objective 
## Predict Stock Prices
Develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast future stock prices based on historical data and financial indicators.

## Contribute to Research
Expand the understanding of how machine learning can be applied to financial forecasting and share findings with the research community.

## Enhanced Investment Decisions
Provide investors with data-driven insights to help them make more informed and profitable investment decisions.

# Proposed Methodology
#### Data Collection
Gather historical stock data, financial indicators, and other relevant information from reliable sources.

#### Data Preprocessing
Clean and transform the data to ensure it is in the format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

#### feature Engineering
Identify and extract the most relevant feature from the data that can contribute to accurate price predictions.

#### Model Training
Train various supervised learning models, such as regression algorithms, to predict future stock prices.

#### Model Evaluation
Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics, such as RMSE, MSE and MAE.
